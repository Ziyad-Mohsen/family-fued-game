        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Teams:</strong> Divide players into two teams. Each team
            takes turns guessing answers to survey questions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Objective:</strong> Guess the most popular answers to survey
            questions to earn points.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rounds:</strong> The game consists of multiple rounds. Each
            round has one survey question with several hidden answers ranked by
            popularity.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Host Page:</strong> Open
            <a href="host.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >host.html</a
            >
            in a separate window or device. It displays all survey questions and
            answers for the host only.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Game Board:</strong> Use
            <a href="index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >index.html</a
            >
            on the main display for players. It shows the answer board and
            strike indicators.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Recommended Setup:</strong> Use two screens/devices—one for
            the host and one for the players.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The host reads a survey question from
            <a href="host.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >host.html</a
            >
            aloud.
          </li>
          <li>
            Teams alternate guessing answers. If a guessed answer is correct,
            the host reveals it on
            <a href="index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >index.html</a
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a team guesses incorrectly, they receive a strike (up to 3).
          </li>
          <li>
            The round ends when all answers are revealed or one team accumulates
            3 strikes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Points are awarded based on the value of revealed answers. The team
            with the most points at the end wins!
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="tip">
          <strong>Tip:</strong> For best results, use <em>two devices</em>: one
          for the host (to control questions and answers) and one for displaying
          the game board to players.
